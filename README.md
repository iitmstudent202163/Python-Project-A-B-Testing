# Python Projects-A/B Testing
## Description:
This project is a demonstration of conducting A/B testing using Python. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook that shows how to design, implement, and analyze an A/B test. 
## Motivation
The goal of this project is to provide a practical and accessible introduction to A/B testing, using Python as the main tool. The project is aimed at beginners who are new to A/B testing, and want to learn how to conduct their own tests.
## A/B Testing
In A/B testing, we analyze the results of two marketing strategies to choose the best one for future marketing campaigns. For example, consider a case where you started an ad campaign on Instagram to promote your Instagram post for the very first time, your target audience was different from the target audience of your second ad campaign. After analyzing the results of both ad campaigns, you will always prefer the audience of the second ad campaign if it gave better reach and followers than the first one.

That is what A/B testing means. Your goal can be to boost sales, followers, or traffic, but when we choose the best marketing strategy according to the results of our previous marketing campaigns, it is nothing but A/B testing.

For the task of A/B testing using Python, we need to have a dataset about two different marketing strategies for the same goal.
A/B Testing Case Study
A/B testing helps in finding a better approach to finding customers, marketing products, getting a higher reach, or anything that helps a business convert most of its target customers into actual customers.

Here is a dataset based on A/B testing submitted by İlker Yıldız on Kaggle. Below are all the features in the dataset:

1. Campaign Name: The name of the campaign.
2. Date: Date of the record.
3. Spend: Amount spent on the campaign in dollars.
4. of Impressions: Number of impressions the ad crossed through the campaign.
5. Reach: The number of unique impressions received in the ad.
6. of Website Clicks: Number of website clicks received through the ads.
7. of Searches: Number of users who performed searches on the website. 
8. of View Content: Number of users who viewed content and products on the website.
9. of Add to Cart: Number of users who added products to the cart.
10. of Purchase: Number of purchases.

Two campaigns were performed by the company:
1. Control Campaign.
2. Test Campaign.

Perform A/B testing to find the best campaign for the company to get more customers.
